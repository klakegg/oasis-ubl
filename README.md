<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The purpose of this repository is to support committee-member collaborative activity in developing releases of the UBL committee's flagship work product, the UBL OASIS Standard.  The initial Maintainer is <a href="mailto:gkholman@CraneSoftwrights.com">G. Ken Holman</a> (GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/gkholman">gkholman</a>) of <a href="http://www.cranesoftwrights.com/">Crane Softwrights Ltd.</a>. Until further notice, questions regarding this repository may be directed to Ken.</p>

<p>The Universal Business Language (UBL) is an open library of standard electronic XML business documents for procurement and transportation such as purchase orders, invoices, transport logistics and waybills.</p>

<p>UBL defines "a generic XML interchange format for business documents that can be restricted or extended to meet the requirements of particular industries. Specifically, UBL provides the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A suite of structured business objects and their associated semantics expressed as reusable data components and common business documents</li>
<li>A library of XML schemas for reusable data components such as "Address", "Item", and "Payment" &mdash; the common data elements of everyday business documents</li>
<li>A set of XML schemas for common business documents such as "Order", "Despatch Advice", and "Invoice" that are constructed from the UBL library components and can be used in generic procurement and transportation contexts..."</li>
</ul>
